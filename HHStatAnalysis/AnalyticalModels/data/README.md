The coefficients calculated bin by bin are in "coefficientsByBin_klkt.txt"

The bins are defined in the gen-level variables as:

`
     binGenMHH = [250.,270.,300.,330.,360.,390., 420.,450.,500.,550.,600.,700.,800.,1000.] 

     binGenCostS  = [ -1., -0.55,0.55,1.  ] 
`

   ==> The columns are respectivelly: nbins GenMhh GenCostStar NenventsSM NenventsSumV1 A1 A3 A7 errorA1 errorA3 error A7. 

   Where: NenventsSM and NenventsSumV1 is the number of events (in units of 10k events) in that bin,  
   as calculated respectivelly by simulations of  3M events for SM and the nevents calculated from the 12 benchmarks defined in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02245v4.pdf (JHEP version) each one with 100k events
   The numbering of the coefficients follow https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06578
